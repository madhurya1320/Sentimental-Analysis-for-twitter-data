# 🧠 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning  

This project performs **sentiment analysis on Twitter data** using **Deep Learning (LSTM)** models. It classifies tweets into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** categories — helping to analyze public opinion, customer satisfaction, and trending topics in real-time.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
With millions of tweets posted daily, analyzing sentiment can help organizations and researchers understand public mood and behavior.  
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to automate sentiment classification effectively.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

**Languages & Libraries:**  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Flask (for web deployment)

**Tools & Environment:**  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  
- HTML5, CSS3 (for frontend interface)

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow  

1. **Data Collection:** Collected tweets from open datasets (e.g., Kaggle).  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized text by removing special characters, URLs, and stop words.  
3. **Tokenization & Stemming:** Used **NLTK** for efficient text vectorization.  
4. **Model Building:** Built an **LSTM-based neural network** using TensorFlow/Keras.  
5. **Model Training:** Trained on labeled sentiment datasets with >90% accuracy.  
6. **Deployment:** Integrated model with **Flask** for real-time sentiment prediction.
